## My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:

I can more confidently conceptualize the flow of logic and the steps I need to do in my code. I can also utilize extra tools like CSS to customize the look of my HTML, which I had not previously realized was a separate file from the main code.

## I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

I still have a habit of implementing code from websites or other people that I don't fully understand and it comes back to mess me up later down the line. I should make sure I know what type of code I'm putting in or else if it causes issues, I will have a much harder time trying to find out where or how the error is occuring. 

## I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:

I admit that I often had to resort to the screencast, as there often was not an attempt that I didn't get stuck on something at some point. However, doing them over and over again let me synthesize the information and I could do it on an attempt without looking anymore.

## The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:

Labs are pretty helpful as they are the tutorial portions of this course where we go through basic applications of the new concepts we are learning. It is a bit hard to finish some parts that feel like we need more guidance that we aren't able to finish in class. I often have to look up more resources to help answer the questions or complete the code.

## I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:

Yes and no. Assignment 1 was definitely hard because it was building the foundation of the website mostly from scratch, so Assignment 2 should be a bit easier considering it is just adding some further details to the site. However, I often underestimate what those details imply and how they can change the code I had for the initial Assignment 1. 

## I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

I felt the pace of the class was a little jarring. At some points it feels super fast and other points super slow. I think this also caused some confusion in the scheduling and planning for where we are in the lesson and what we know / don't know. I also thought some questions in Labs / Assignments could use a little more clarity. I undertand that part of coding is not getting spoon-fed the steps to complete a task, but I also think the wording of certain things caused misunderstandings that threw me and some peers off. 

## What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):

WODs and Labs, when I understood what I needed to do and how to do it, where the best because you learn from doing it hands on. I also enjoy screencasts even though they could be called a crutch. They were the most efficient in not only helping me find the next step forward as they would explain the steps and why they did it, but it also helped me realize the errors I made in the code I tried to make myself.
